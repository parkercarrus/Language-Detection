# Language-Detection
An artificial neural network built to distinguish between english and spanish text. 
<br> This is my first project that incorporates a form of artificial intelligence.

To run the file, downlaod both 'predict.py' (user interface to make predictions) and the folder 'ann_updated' (the already trained neural network).
<br>
<br> If you wish to create a model, simply download 'model_maker.py' and run the script configuring layers, epochs, and batch size however you wish. To then use this model to make predictions, in 'predictions.py', in line 62 change "ann_updated" to the name of the newly created folder. 

I will try to update this repository whenever something new comes up. Hopefully making some cool projects soon as well!

This project uses the repositories: words/an-array-of-spanish-words and words/an-array-of-english-words.
